**MID-COURSE PROJECT | MOB** 	 						

Your project will be assessed using the following standards:

  - [ ] Technical: App Standards & Code
  - [ ] Performance: Execution & Communication

Acceptable performance for this standard is based on how well you've completed the required deliverables. To review the full list of MOB standards, see the course syllabus.

## Technical

**Expectations**: Did you build an app from scratch without an existing codebase? Did you create a simple (no persistence, no networking) app with defined, familiar and expected behavior? Did you build the end-to-end components?

#### Evaluation
> Mark boxes with an 'X'

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Stability & Performance:** Code does not have major bugs and correctly uses all APIs. No significant performance issues. Edge cases caught and errors handled and surfaced correctly. No obvious crashes on manual code. | | | | |
| **Style & Readability:** Consistent style throughout codebase that aligns with other iOS APIs. Commented well. Variable and function names are clear and consistent. | | | | |
| **OO and App Design:** No tightly coupled classes. All classes do one thing and do it well. Elegant use of iOS design patterns and extensive use of inheritance/OO concepts. Minimal code duplication. | | | | |

Notes:


## Performance

**Expectations**: Did you clearly communicate an app idea/technical architecture to a technical audience? Did you use a basic task tracking system to break up your project into granular tasks?

#### Evaluation
> Mark boxes with an 'X'

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **App Readiness:** App is usable and easily understandable. No major bugs for common or 'error' use cases.| | | | |
| **Execution & Scope:** Meets all required features plus some bonus features. Work items tracked on task tracker. | | | | |
| **Presentation & Communication (Optional):** Present team's implementation and alternative implementations. Efficiently communicate an elegant argument for chosen implementation. Answer questions and tradeoffs between chosen and alternate implementations. | | | | |
